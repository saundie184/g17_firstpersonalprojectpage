      <h2>Why gSchool?</h2>
        <p>I have been working in a marketing agency for the last three and half years, but I wanted to do more than what I was
        doing. I wanted more challenge and creativity. When I first started looking into coding, I was overwhelmed with all the
        languages and possiblities, but after going to a Ruby on Rails Meet-up, I became more excited about the opportunities with
        programming.</p>
      <h2>Aspirations</h2>
        <p>I have always loved technology. It's so powerful, and there is a lot to explore. I love working in the tech world because
          someone is always creating something new. Before gSchool, I had been writing
          on the front side of websites (copywriting), but now I am excited to be on the side of building things. I'm looking
          forward to learning more about what is happening in programming and where I can go with it. I really don't know what kind of
          company I'd like to work with after gSchool, but right now, I'm really enjoying learning and exploring.
