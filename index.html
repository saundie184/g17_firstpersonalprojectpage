  <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am Texas-raised but Colorado-born. I grew up in Plano, Texas, a large suberb of Dallas. I spent my summers
    in Estes Park, which explains why I've always loved the mountains. After communting in Dallas traffic for year,
  I left my job and the lovely tollroads and moved to Colorado. I've never looked back.

  <h3>Common questions I get asked</h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do you miss Texas?</li>
      <li>Where's your accent?</li>
      <li>Where does your name come from?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Who I am</h2>
    <h3>My real name is...Cassandra</h3>
    <p>I have an older brother and younger sister. Being the middle child has it's advantages. For instance,
      I could pick which one to side with and we would gang up on the other (usually my sis and I teamed up against my bro).
